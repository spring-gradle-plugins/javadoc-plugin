= Aggregate Javadoc Gradle Plugin

Provides support for producing an aggregate Javadoc that follows Gradle best practices.
This plugin is based on https://github.com/jjohannes/gradle-demos/blob/master/aggregated-javadoc[work by jjohannes].

== Downloading

Releases are deployed to the https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.spring.javadoc-aggregate[Gradle Plugin Portal].

If you are using a SNAPSHOT, first ensure your `settings.gradle` is updated to resolve plugins from `repo.spring.io` as shown below:

.settings.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
pluginManagement {
	repositories {
		gradlePluginPortal()
		maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/plugins-snapshot' }
	}
}
----

== io.spring.javadoc

Next apply the plugin to each module that should be included in the aggregate Javadoc.
The `io.spring.javadoc` serves as a marker to determine which projects are included in the aggregate Javadoc.
As illustrated below, it is also necessary to apply the `JavaPlugin` to the project.

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
plugins {
	id 'java-library'
	id 'io.spring.javadoc' version '{version}'
}
----

== io.spring.javadoc-aggregate

Next apply the `AggregateJavadoc` plugin to a project that will produce the aggregate Javadoc.

.aggregator/build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
plugins {
	id 'io.spring.javadoc-aggregate' version '{version}'
}
----

=== aggregateJavadocClasspath Configuration

This will create a `Configuration` named `aggregateJavadocClasspath` that is used to determine the classpath for the <<aggregateJavadoc Task>>.
This `Configuration` is defaulted to include all projects that have the `io.spring.javadoc` applied to it.

=== aggregateJavadoc Task

This will create a task named `aggregateJavadoc` of type https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html[`Javadoc`].
The task defaults the https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc:source[source] and https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc:classpath[classpath] to aggregate values based on all of the projects that contain the `io.spring.javadoc` plugin.

Finally, run the task.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :aggregator:aggregateJavadoc
----


[NOTE]
====
For our example, we assume that `io.spring.javadoc-aggregate` is applied to the project `aggregator`.
You may apply to any module, but you will need to adjust the task accordingly.
====

=== Excluding a Default Project

You can exclude projects that are included by default using Gradle's build in exclusion mechanism.
For example, the following would exclude `module2` from being aggregated:

[source,groovy]
----
configurations.aggregateJavadocClasspath {
    exclude module: 'module2'
}
----

=== Customizing Aggregated Projects

You can customize which projects' Javadoc is aggregated by explicitly providing projects for the `aggregateJavadocClasspath` configuration.
For example, the following explicitly aggregates `module1` and `module2` regardless of which projects have `io.spring.javadoc` applied to them.

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'io.spring.javadoc-aggregate'
}

dependencies {
    aggregateJavadocClasspath project(':module1')
    aggregateJavadocClasspath project(':module3')
}
----

== io.spring.javadoc-conventions

Apply the `io.spring.javadoc-conventions` plugin to default the https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html[`Javadoc`] task options.

The following defaults will be set:

* `author` is defaulted to `true`
* `docTitle`  defaulted to a modified value of the root project's name
** If it ends in `-build`, it will be stripped off
** Any `-` will be replaced with a space ` `
** Each word will be capitalized
* `encoding` is defaulted to `UTF-8`
* `memberLevel` is defaulted to `JavadocMemberLevel.PROTECTED`
* `outputLevel` is defaulted to `JavadocOutputLevel.QUIET`
* `splitIndex` is defaulted to `true`
* `stylesheetFile` is defaulted to Spring's default stylesheet
* `use` is defaulted to `true`
* `windowTitle` is defaulted to the same value as `docTitle`
