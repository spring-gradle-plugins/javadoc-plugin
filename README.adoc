= Aggregate Javadoc Gradle Plugin

Provides support for producing an aggregate Javadoc that follows Gradle best practices.
This plugin is based on https://github.com/jjohannes/gradle-demos/blob/master/aggregated-javadoc[work by jjohannes].

== Downloading

Releases are deployed to the https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.spring.javadoc-aggregate[Gradle Plugin Portal].

If you are using a SNAPSHOT, first ensure your `settings.gradle` is updated to resolve plugins from `repo.spring.io` as shown below:

.settings.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
pluginManagement {
	repositories {
		gradlePluginPortal()
		maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/plugins-snapshots' }
	}
}
----

== io.spring.javadoc

Next apply the plugin to each module that should be included in the aggregate Javadoc.
The `io.spring.javadoc` serves as a marker to determine which projects are included in the aggregate Javadoc.
As illustrated below, it is also necessary to apply the `JavaPlugin` to the project.

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
plugins {
	id 'java-library'
	id 'io.spring.javadoc' version '{version}'
}
----

== io.spring.javadoc-aggregate

Next apply the `AggregateJavadoc` plugin to a project that will produce the aggregate Javadoc.

.aggregator/build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
plugins {
	id 'io.spring.javadoc-aggregate' version '{version}'
}
----

=== aggregateJavadocClasspath Configuration

This will create a `Configuration` named `aggregateJavadocClasspath` that is used to determine the classpath for the <<aggregateJavadoc Task>>.
This `Configuration` is defaulted to include all projects that have the `io.spring.javadoc` applied to it.

=== aggregateJavadoc Task

This will create a task named `aggregateJavadoc` of type https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html[`Javadoc`].
The task defaults the https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc:source[source] and https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc:classpath[classpath] to aggregate values based on all of the projects that contain the `io.spring.javadoc` plugin.

Finally, run the task.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :aggregator:aggregateJavadoc
----


[NOTE]
====
For our example, we assume that `io.spring.javadoc-aggregate` is applied to the project `aggregator`.
You may apply to any module, but you will need to adjust the task accordingly.
====

=== Customizing Aggregated Projects

You can customize which projects' Javadoc is aggregated by explicitly providing projects for the `aggregateJavadocClasspath` configuration.
For example, the following explicitly aggregates `module1` and `module2` regardless of which projects have `io.spring.javadoc` applied to them.

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'io.spring.javadoc-aggregate'
}

dependencies {
    aggregateJavadocClasspath project(':module1')
    aggregateJavadocClasspath project(':module3')
}
----
